## About Me

Hi, my name is Derrick, I go by Cottontail on nearly all of the platforms I use from discord to steam and much more. I'm passionate about self-hosting, automation and docker as these are some of the things I am currently learning.

I am not much of a coder so bear with my horrible coding.

## Skills

Some of the skills I have developed while working on my Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Systems:

- **Programming Languages:** Python & Java
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- **Databases:** Oracle, MariaDB, MySQL
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, VS Code, Ansible

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I am working on:

- **[docker-containers](https://github.com/derrickdryer/docker-containers):** A collection of my self configured ocker containers I use on my home lab environment.
- **[ansible-playbook](https://github.com/derrickdryer/ansible-playbook):** A repo full of my ansible playbooks I am developing to automate my home lab environment
- **[senior-capstone](https://gihub.com/derrickdryer/senior-capstone):** This is a large-ish scale project I am working on with two other people to showcase the skills and concepts learned in university.
